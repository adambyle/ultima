## Contributing guidelines

As this is a one-man job, I often overlook code changes and bug fixes that would make life better for everyone. If you spot something in my code that could use a patch, go ahead and make a pull request! I will be very grateful for any sleep you allow me to have by finding and patching those pesky bugs.

I will usually not accept pull requests containing proposed features, unless it was something I was already planning on doing myself, in which case, thanks a bunch, you saved me a bit of work.
