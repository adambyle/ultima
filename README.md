Ultima Battle Royale is a PvP minigame designed for from 2 to around 8 players. It offers fast-paced, inclusive, and balanced fun for small groups of varying ability. Games are designed to be quick, and some game modes will attempt to put as many players in as possible so that everyone gets as much time to play as possible. Ultima was designed with play-time in mind.

You can play Ultima by downloading the map from the Releases section on the Code page, where you are probably currently reading this. It is free to play and distribute. You will need a server (and other players) to enjoy Ultima. If something seems to be going wrong, be sure to report the bug on the Issues page. Redownloading and installing the data pack (also in Releases), if you know how to do that, may solve the problem. You can always message me on Discord (`beegyfleeg#6616`) or Reddit ([`u/beegyfleeg`](https://www.reddit.com/user/beegyfleeg)) with any questions you have.

## The Game Modes

Ultima offers game modes for different sizes and playstyles of groups.

**Duels** 2+ players
* A sequence of 1v1 battles between two players
* When multiple players are present, players will take turns participating in the duel
* Quick and seamless games, no delay times

**Royale** 3 or 4 players
* Last man standing wins
* Similar to "Ultimate Tag", if the player who killed you gets killed themself, you get to respawn
* Not very play-time friendly, but more strategic and organized

**Brawl** 3+ players
* First person to a certain score wins
* Points are earned by defeating your opponents, you earn more or less points for different types of kills
* You respawn whenever there is an open spot in the game (up to four players at once)
* Very chaotic, but keeps as many players in the game having fun as possible

## Content

Ultima comes with a total of 12 maps, 8 default maps and 4 featured maps made by other players, with more to come. For now, I will not be accepting featured maps from people other than my close friends, but this may change in the future.

While you wait for your turn to play, or for players who want to hang out with their friends but don't want to PvP, Ultima also has a parkour section with an integrated best time leaderboard, if that's your thing. Parkour courses are planned for each of the default maps.
