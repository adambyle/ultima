# Contributing to Ultima

Ultima is a partially community project. You are always welcome to help develop the game into something greater! One of the most helpful things you can do is boost its publicity. There are many ways to do this:

1. Host Ultima on your private server and play with friends! The easiest thing you can do to help is download and play.
2. Share the world download with others! Host it on a website, share over Discord, make a post on Reddit, or email. Bringing attention to the game will help me make it better.
3. Submit content to the game! Follow the submission processes below. By adding your own content to the game, you will help make updates more frequent and content heavy.

## Submitting Content

Builders are always welcome to submit maps. Build the map in an empty world and share the `zip` file with me over Discord. I will review the map and add it as soon as possible if it gets approved! Read below on the details of map creation.

Developers should use their skills to investigate any errors. The source code is available on GitHub! I am currently not looking for direct collaboration on any part of development, but reporting issues and proposing changes is always a big help. Additionally, a modding API may be released in the near future to make adding non-map content much easier.

## Creating a Map

You can submit maps to be added to the Featured Maps in Ultima, in addition to a special place in the credits. Follow these steps to create a good map:

- The map can be any size. If you're curious, the default maps are 31 x 15 x 31 blocks, including the walls. It is preferrable that the map is no larger than 90 x 90 x 90.
- Create the map in a void preset superflat world. It is easiest to transfer from there.
- The theme should not reference popular culture.
- The map should be a location or environment, as opposed to an abstract or art-like build.
- Clearly mark four locations for player spawning, preferably near the corners. No player should have an advantage from where they spawn.
- Limit your use of blocks that can be interacted with (containers, doors, switches).

You must submit the following to me over Discord:

1. A `zip` file containing the map.
2. The name you would like to give the map (you may ask me for suggestions).
3. A summary of the items and mechanics of the map.
